# ProcessWire PageReferencesTab #

A little addon to display pages referencing the page being currently edited.

* Lists references via Page fields in a new tab (References).
* Enabled templates can be chosen via module settings. If no template is chosen, the tab is shown regardless of the template.
* System templates and fields are always skipped: Tab wont be added when editing a page with a system template and references from system fields are not shown.
